Why Replit is complaining
The “Would you like to run dig from Nix and add it to your project?” prompt wants to edit the hidden .replit file.
Replit marks that file protected, so the automatic edit is blocked, and you get the error loop.

Good news: you don’t actually need to modify the project to run dig.
You can either:

use nslookup, which is already available, or

run dig in a one-off Nix shell (no project edits), or

use any web-based dig tool.

Below are all three options—pick whichever is easiest.

Option A – use nslookup inside Replit (already installed)
bash
Copy
Edit
# Show root record
nslookup arcsyn.studio

# Show www record
nslookup www.arcsyn.studio
You’ll see something like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Name:   arcsyn.studio
Address:  216.24.57.1            # (A-record)  ──► good
or

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Name:   arcsyn.studio
arcsyn.studio   canonical name = arcsyn-chat-grimoire-v2-1.onrender.com.
Either result is fine; you just need to verify it points to Render’s host/IP.

Option B – run dig without altering .replit
bash
Copy
Edit
# Launch a temporary nix shell that has dig
nix-shell -p dnsutils --run "dig +short arcsyn.studio ; dig +short www.arcsyn.studio"
Because this happens in an ephemeral shell, it does not touch your project files.

Option C – quick web checker
Open https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/

Enter arcsyn.studio, press Enter

Repeat with www.arcsyn.studio (type = CNAME)

How to interpret the output
What dig / nslookup returns	Is it correct?	Next action
arcsyn-chat-grimoire-v2-1.onrender.com. (CNAME)	✅ Yes	Go to Render → Custom Domains → Retry Certificate
216.24.57.1 (or another Render IP)	✅ Yes	Same as above
pixie.porkbun.com or nothing	❌ Still Porkbun default / not propagated	In Porkbun DNS delete the old ALIAS, then add:
• ALIAS (root) → arcsyn-chat-grimoire-v2-1.onrender.com
• CNAME www → same target. Wait 5-10 min, test again.

Once both records resolve to Render, click Retry Certificate in Render.
When the certificate status turns green, https://arcsyn.studio and https://www.arcsyn.studio will load your app over HTTPS.
